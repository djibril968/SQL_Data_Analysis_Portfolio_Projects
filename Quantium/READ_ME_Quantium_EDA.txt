Exploratory Data Analysis

Project Objectives:

To analyze and identify distinct customer segments and their chip purchasing behavior.

In line with our task, we shall take a deep dive into our dataset to provide answers to the following questions:

Total Revenue and Change Over the Years: How has total revenue from chip purchases changed over the years, and what are the key drivers of these changes?

Total Number of Transactions/Chip Purchases: What is the total number of chip purchases, and how does this vary by month or season? Are there any noticeable patterns or trends?

Product Categories: What are the most popular product categories, and how do their sales volumes compare to each other? Are there any notable shifts in product preferences?

Average Order Value (AOV): What is the average order value (AOV), and how does this vary by product category? Are certain categories driving higher AOV?

Total Number of Stores: How many stores are included in the analysis? Has this number changed over time, and what might be the reasons behind such changes?

Active Stores: How many stores are currently active, and how does this number change over time? What factors influence store activity?
Purchase Frequency: What is the purchase frequency of customers? Do some segments buy chips more frequently than others?
Repeat Customers: How many repeat customers are there, and what percentage of sales do they represent? What strategies can be employed to increase customer retention?

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary): Can we segment customers based on RFM values? What insights can be gain from these segments?

Churned Customers: How many customers have churned, and what percentage of sales do they represent? What actions can be taken to reduce churn?

Top and Least Selling Products: Which products are the top sellers, and how have their sales trends changed over time? What about the least selling products?

Top and Least Grossing Products: Which products generate the highest and lowest gross revenue, and how have their sales changed over time?

Products Bought Together: What products are often bought together in the same transaction? Can we recommend product bundles to boost sales?

Average Spend Across Customer Segments: What is the average amount spent by customers across different customer segments? Are there segments that spend significantly more?

These questions will guide the analysis and help us gain valuable insights into customer purchase behavior and chip sales.
